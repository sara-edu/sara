SARA Institute is a leading data science education institute. It is an entity of SARA EDUCATION TRUST registered under Section 60 non-profit.  

Are you interested in supporting the institute and its educators? Sadly, right now, we do not have tax-deductible 80G and 12A certificates. We also cannot accept international donation as we do not have FCRA certificate from the Government of India. 

Donations in support of SARA EDUCATION TRUST and SARA Institute are welcomed. Interested international donors can support us with the help of their family and friends in India.

Interested donors please reach us at sara.institute.info@gmail.com
